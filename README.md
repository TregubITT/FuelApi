# FuelApi
Would like to note this is a test task, so a lot of functionality is out of scope.
out of scope were things like error handlers, validations, etc
The Key Points that were not realized is the:
1. API or DataBase availability monitor.
2. Approach to solving unexpected cases, such as restart server, etc. propably need to wrapp all crud operations in transaction, to ensure the consistency of data
